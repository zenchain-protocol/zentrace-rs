# Zentrace Rust Services

Zentrace is a comprehensive block explorer and analytics platform tailored for the Zenchain blockchain. Originating as a fork from Blockscout, Zentrace has undergone significant enhancements to improve functionality and ease of deployment across various operating systems.

Zentrace ecosystem consists of the following components:

- Zentrace Backend <https://github.com/zenchain-protocol/zentrace-backend>
- Zentrace Frontend <https://github.com/zenchain-protocol/zentrace-frontend>
- Zentrace Rust Services (**the current repository**)

## Available Rust Services list

- Smart Contract Verifier ([smart-contract-verifier](smart-contract-verifier)): provides API for Ethereum contract verification written in Solidity and Vyper.
- Signatures Provider ([sig-provider](sig-provider)): aggregator of Ethereum signatures for transactions and events.
- EVM Visualizer ([visualizer](visualizer)): service for evm visualization such as Solidity contract visualization.
- Ethereum Bytecode Database ([eth-bytecode-db](eth-bytecode-db)): verifies smart contracts and searches for the sources via bytecodes.

# Development environment configuration

The process of setting up the development environment for Zentrace Rust Services, which is built using the Rust programming language, differs depending on the operating system in use. Rust's inherently multiplatform nature ensures that Zentrace Rust Services can be developed across various environments, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This tutorial is designed to guide you through the preparation of your development environment, tailored to each of these operating systems.

```

Execute the following command to install additional deps:

```bash
brew install openssl wget
```

##### Protocol Buffers v25.2

Execute the following commands:

###### Intel CPU

```bash
wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v25.2/protoc-25.2-osx-x86_64.zip -O ./protoc.zip
unzip protoc.zip -d protoc
sudo mv ./protoc/include/* /usr/local/include

sudo mv ./protoc/bin/protoc /opt/bin/protoc
```

##### Protocol Buffers Gen OpenAPI v2.19.0

Execute the following commands:

###### Intel CPU

```bash
wget https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/download/v2.19.0/protoc-gen-openapiv2-v2.19.0-darwin-x86_64 -O ./protoc-gen-openapiv2

\*\* If you encounter "Operation not permitted" error, you need to give full disk access to the `Terminal` and disable `System Integrity Protection` from the recovery Terminal.

#### Windows

##### LLVM

Download and execute the installer <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-18.1.2/LLVM-18.1.2-win64.exe>

##### Protocol Buffers v25.2

<https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v25.2/protoc-25.2-win64.zip>

Once downloaded, extracts all files in a choosen path; then create the `PROTOC` environment variable that points to the protocol buffer executable, for example:

```bash
setx PROTOC C:\protoc\bin\protoc.exe /m
```

then restart the shell.

##### Protocol Buffers Gen OpenAPI v2.19.0

<https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/download/v2.19.0/protoc-gen-openapiv2-v2.19.0-windows-x86_64.exe>

Once downloaded, copy the file in a folder under `C:`, then add the folder path to the `PATH` environment variable.

## How to compile

Create a new folder, open it in the terminal and execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenchain-protocol/zentrace-rs
```

authenticate to GitHub, after confirmation, git starts cloning the repository.

Open the service specific folder and execute the following commands:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Docker based development

You can also build and run each service within Docker directly.

### Without docker-compose

Open the service specific folder and then execute:

```bash
docker build -t zentrace/SERVICE_NAME .
```

then you can start the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -dp localhost:PORT:PORT zentrace/SERVICE_NAME
```

### With docker-compose

Open the service specific folder and then execute:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

starts a container using the `zentrace/SERVICE_NAME` built image and starts listening using the ports specified in the docker-compose.yml configuration file.
